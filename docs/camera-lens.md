# ColorOS camera Lens integration (experimental)

This integration is opt-in (`camera_lens`) and requires the `com.oplus.camera` LSPosed scope. Restart Camera and Google after changing it. Existing Google Lens eligibility and the companion module are independent.

## Inspected native sources

International CPH2653 / V16.1.0 Camera 6.070.230 and CN PLK110 / V17.0.0 Camera 7.006.125 both retain `key_show_googlelens_icon`, the native menu descriptor, and a presenter click handler that calls `startActivityForResult` with `ACTION_VIEW`, `googleapp://lens`, and the Google app package. The floating-button show/hide code is incomplete in both inspected builds. The CN presenter also returns false for the ordinary photo mode.

DexKit anchors the native menu using the option key and `com.oplus.camera.feature.google_lens`, then finds the native Lens presenter from its unchanged `googleapp://lens` click handler and mode strings. Native listener predicates, the normal-entry delegate, lock-state getter and UI-context accessor are bound once. Both real APKs passed full discovery and reflection binding on the connected CN device. The descriptor cache uses a separate `camera_lens.native-v1` entry; former menu descriptors/misses are discarded without invalidating Google Lens or Wallet caches. Only the menu gate and direct menu/presenter callers are deoptimized.

The hook restores only the missing `common` branch of the CN native presenter. It calls the camera's existing support, children-mode, initialization, normal-entry and front-camera APIs. Lock eligibility follows the inspected international conjunction: deny when the native device-lock getter and native secure UI flag are both true. Unlocking within the same secure-camera session can therefore recover eligibility. Other mode branches execute the original presenter. Native event handlers still control visibility during capture/recording; native menu/click handling still controls launch and statistics. No separate Intent whitelist, Activity-field guessing, PackageManager lookup or module-defined mode/lock policy remains.

Google 17.66.11's inspected native Lens gateway checks OEM eligibility using `com.google.lens.feature.CAMERA_INTEGRATION` and `ro.com.google.lens.oem_camera_package`. Both are absent on the tested CN phone. Google-process-only framework hooks expose the feature and append `com.oplus.camera` to the package declaration while the opt-in is enabled. Other features/properties and existing package entries retain their original values. No global system property or companion file is changed.

## Verification

`testHookLifecycle` includes the native presenter callback (children/support/entry predicates, front-camera denial, native lock/UI conjunction, unlock recovery, original modes, missing state, live disable and incompatible binding), former-cache migration, and Google OEM declaration tests. Removing the children-mode guard was rejected by the regression test. `tests/run_camera_dex_test.py` executes the production locator and binding against supplied APKs without installing an application or changing phone settings. Both extracted Camera APKs passed, including cached descriptors; this does not establish live UI behavior for the revised hook.

Device test: the initial menu hook launched `LensDeeplink`, which immediately finished. After adding the OEM eligibility declaration and restarting Camera/Google, the user confirmed successful Lens UI launch on the CN OnePlus 15.

Future camera builds must retain the native anchors, named presenter APIs, normal-entry instruction shape and typed secure UI field `EventMessageUIContainerContext.b`. Ambiguous lookup or incompatible binding retains original camera behavior. Google may change its OEM declaration mechanism; universal update compatibility is not claimed.
